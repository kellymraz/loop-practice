<!-- Notes on BOOTSTRAP

WEbsite is getbootstrap.com   gives you documentation on all that it offers.

Sart with html and css

It contains a grid system, so you can build your website around a grid.  the grid system is fully responive and customizable to any screen size and is designed for mobile-first

On the website is a tab called customize.  You can include and exclude things.  

all the way down at the bottom of the page is the compile and download button that will download a zip file.

includes a css folder, fonts, and a javascript folder

this lecture will be mostly about css


how do you use it?  is it just css?

look at the website!!  Most common way is using their classes. Use add classes to elements you define inl your html, then have bootstrap modify those classes

You will use containers.
Say you want to put an h1 in a contaiiner.  create an html div with the class of container

<div class="container"/>Use CDN Bootscrap CDN

copy the css http link and paste it into sublime, adding a new link tag in the head, before the css file, so you can customize -->
